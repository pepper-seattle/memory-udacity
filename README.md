# Memory Game

The memory game is a simple way to test your brain while having fun! 

## How to Play

Click or tap a card to flip it over. As you flip cards remember their symbol and placement with the aim of matching two of the same cards. 

Once you have all cards matched up the time will stop and you'll see how you faired. Play again to try to beat your last time!
